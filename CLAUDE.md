This file contains guidelines and context for working with Claude AI on the academic-workflow-suite project.

## Project Overview

The academic-workflow-suite is designed to streamline and automate common academic workflows. This project aims to provide tools and utilities for researchers, students, and academics to manage their work more efficiently.

## Working with Claude

### Getting Started

When working with Claude on this project:

1. **Context Sharing**: Provide relevant context about your academic workflow needs
2. **Clear Specifications**: Be specific about the tools or features you want to implement
3. **Iterative Development**: Start with core functionality and expand incrementally

### Project Goals

- Automate repetitive academic tasks
- Integrate with common academic tools and platforms
- Maintain clean, well-documented code
- Follow best practices for software development

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards

- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Include error handling and validation

### Testing

- Test new features thoroughly before committing
- Include unit tests for critical functionality
- Document test cases and expected behavior

### Documentation

- Update README.md with new features
- Document API endpoints and functions
- Maintain changelog for version updates

## Common Tasks

### Adding New Features

1. Discuss the feature requirements with Claude
2. Plan the implementation approach
3. Write and test the code
4. Update documentation
5. Commit with descriptive messages

### Debugging

- Provide error messages and stack traces
- Describe expected vs actual behavior
- Share relevant code context

### Refactoring

- Identify code that needs improvement
- Discuss the refactoring strategy
- Ensure tests pass after changes

(To be expanded as the project grows)

## Tips for Effective Collaboration

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "add a feature," say "add a citation manager that supports BibTeX"
2. **Provide Examples**: Share sample inputs/outputs when possible
3. **Ask Questions**: If something is unclear, ask for clarification
4. **Iterate**: Start simple and refine based on feedback

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Check repository status
git status

# Run tests (when implemented)
npm test

# Build the project (when build system is added)
npm run build
```

## Future Considerations

- Integration with academic databases (PubMed, arXiv, Google Scholar)
- Citation management and bibliography generation
- Research paper organization and note-taking
- Collaboration tools for academic teams
- Data analysis and visualization utilities

## Questions or Issues?

When working with Claude:
- Ask for explanations of code or decisions
- Request alternative approaches if needed
- Discuss trade-offs between different solutions
