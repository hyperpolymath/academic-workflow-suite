# Scope

## In Scope

- All repositories under github.com/Hyperpolymath/academic-workflow-suite
- Core engine (Rust components)
- AI jail container security
- Office add-in
- Backend API
- Cryptographic implementations (SHA3-512 anonymization)
- Event store security
- PII detection and sanitization
- Container isolation
- Network security

## Out of Scope

- Third-party dependencies (report to upstream)
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security
- Denial of service (DoS) attacks
- Issues in older unsupported versions

## Vulnerability Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure:

1. **Report** via security@academic-workflow-suite.org or GitHub Security Advisories
2. **Acknowledgment** within 24-48 hours
3. **Investigation** within 7 days
4. **Fix Development** coordinated timeline
5. **Disclosure** after patch release (typically 90 days)

## Severity Classification

**Critical** (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- PII data leakage to AI
- Student ID de-anonymization
- Container escape

**High** (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- Privilege escalation
- Information disclosure (non-PII)
- SQL injection
- XSS in Office add-in

**Medium** (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- Limited information disclosure
- CSRF
- Insecure defaults

**Low** (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- Minor information leaks
- UI bugs with security implications

## Response Times

- **Critical**: Patch within 7 days
- **High**: Patch within 30 days
- **Medium**: Patch within 90 days
- **Low**: Patch in next release

## Bug Bounty

Currently no formal bug bounty program. We recognize security researchers in:
- Hall of Fame: https://academic-workflow-suite.org/security/hall-of-fame
- Release notes
- CONTRIBUTORS.md

## Safe Harbor

We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:
- Act in good faith
- Follow responsible disclosure
- Avoid privacy violations
- Do not access real student data
- Do not cause harm or disruption
- Comply with all applicable laws

# Academic Context

This is educational software handling student data. Special considerations:

## Student Privacy is Paramount

The primary security goal is **protecting student personally identifiable information (PII)**:
- Student IDs must never reach AI systems in cleartext
- SHA3-512 anonymization must be cryptographically sound
- Network isolation of AI jail is critical
- Event store must maintain audit trail integrity

## Regulatory Compliance

Security vulnerabilities affecting GDPR compliance are treated as **Critical**:
- Data minimization failures
- Retention policy violations
- Audit trail tampering
- Right to erasure bypasses

## University Environment

Consider that users are:
- Academic staff (limited technical expertise)
- Institutional IT policies (may restrict updates)
- High-stakes environment (student grades)
