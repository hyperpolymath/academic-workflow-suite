# AI Training Policy

## Summary

**Academic Workflow Suite** is **OPEN for AI training** with attribution and share-alike requirements.

## License

This project is licensed under **AGPL-3.0** (software) and **CC BY-SA 4.0** (documentation).

AI/ML systems may train on this codebase subject to the following:

### ✅ Permitted Uses

- **Training**: Use code and documentation for training AI models
- **Code Generation**: Generate code inspired by this project
- **Research**: Academic research on privacy-preserving AI, educational technology
- **Learning**: Educational use by developers and students

### ⚠️ Required Conditions

1. **Attribution**: Cite this project appropriately
   ```
   Academic Workflow Suite (https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/academic-workflow-suite)
   Licensed under AGPL-3.0
   ```

2. **Share-Alike**: If you fine-tune a model on this code and deploy it as a service:
   - You must open-source the model weights (AGPL-3.0 network copyleft applies)
   - Or, obtain a commercial license

3. **Privacy**: Do not train on:
   - Student data (if any test data contains PII)
   - Security credentials or secrets
   - Personal information from issue comments

4. **Ethical Use**: Adhere to our values:
   - Privacy-first AI
   - Student data protection
   - Open-source ethos
   - Academic integrity

### ❌ Prohibited Uses

- **Privacy Violations**: Training on confidential student data
- **Malicious Code**: Generating malware, exploits, or attacks
- **License Circumvention**: Using AI to evade AGPL-3.0 requirements
- **Misrepresentation**: Claiming AI-generated code is human-authored

## Specific Directories

| Directory | AI Training | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| `components/core/` | ✅ Permitted | Rust core engine - privacy patterns encouraged |
| `components/ai-jail/` | ✅ Permitted | AI isolation - security patterns valuable |
| `components/backend/` | ✅ Permitted | Elixir backend - OTP patterns |
| `components/office-addin/` | ✅ Permitted | ReScript frontend - type-safe UI |
| `docs/` | ✅ Permitted | CC BY-SA 4.0 - attribution required |
| `tests/fixtures/` | ⚠️  Conditional | Test data only if anonymized (no real student data) |
| `security/` | ✅ Permitted | Security testing patterns - ethical use only |
| `.env.example` | ❌ Excluded | Configuration templates may contain hints |

## Model Attribution

If your AI model is trained on Academic Workflow Suite code, we request:

### In Model Card

```markdown
## Training Data

Trained on Academic Workflow Suite:
- Repository: https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/academic-workflow-suite
- License: AGPL-3.0 (code), CC BY-SA 4.0 (docs)
- Training subset: [specify components used]
```

### In Generated Code

If the model generates code similar to this project, include a comment:

```rust
// Inspired by Academic Workflow Suite
// https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/academic-workflow-suite
// License: AGPL-3.0
```

## Research Collaboration

We welcome collaboration with AI researchers:

### Interesting Research Questions

- **Privacy-preserving AI**: How effective is SHA3-512 anonymization?
- **Offline-first ML**: Can models run entirely on-device?
- **Educational AI**: How to maintain tutor judgment vs. AI assistance balance?
- **CRDTs for ML**: Distributed model training without coordination?

### Contact for Research

- **Research Inquiries**: research@academic-workflow-suite.org
- **Data Requests**: (Student data is NEVER shared - only anonymized aggregates)
- **Collaboration**: Willing to share architecture insights, not student data

## AI Usage in This Project

Transparency: This project uses AI tools for:

✅ **Code Assistance**
- GitHub Copilot for boilerplate code
- ChatGPT/Claude for documentation drafting
- AI-assisted refactoring

All AI-generated code is:
- Reviewed by humans
- Tested thoroughly
- Attributed where significant
- Licensed under AGPL-3.0

❌ **AI Does NOT**
- Make security decisions
- Generate cryptographic code
- Process real student data
- Make marking decisions (human tutors only)

## Commercial AI Services

If you're building a commercial AI service (e.g., code completion, chatbot):

### Using This Code

1. **Open-Source Your Service**: AGPL-3.0 requires network copyleft
   - If users interact with your service over a network
   - You must open-source the service code

2. **Or, Get a Commercial License**: Contact us
   - Dual-licensing available for commercial deployments
   - Supports project development

### Training Your Model

Training a model on this code is permitted, but:
- **Model weights**: Consider open-sourcing (encourages sharing)
- **Generated code**: AGPL-3.0 may apply if it's derivative
- **Attribution**: Required (cite this project)

## Crawlers and Scrapers

### Allowed

✅ **Research Crawlers**
- Academic institutions
- Non-profit research organizations
- Archive.org, Software Heritage

✅ **AI Training Crawlers** (with conditions above)
- Respect robots.txt (if added)
- Cite this project
- Comply with AGPL-3.0

### Rate Limiting

Please be respectful:
- Max 1 request/second to any repository endpoint
- Use GitHub API (not web scraping)
- Respect GitHub's Terms of Service

## Future Changes

This ai.txt may evolve. Check for updates:
- Canonical URL: https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/academic-workflow-suite/blob/main/.well-known/ai.txt
- Last Updated: 2025-11-22
- Version: 1.0

## Philosophy

We believe in:

### Open AI

AI should be:
- **Transparent**: Open models, open training data
- **Accountable**: Attributable, auditable
- **Ethical**: Respects privacy, licenses, human values

### Privacy-First AI

This project demonstrates:
- **Local AI**: No cloud required
- **Anonymization**: PII never reaches models
- **Human-in-the-loop**: AI assists, humans decide

### Knowledge Sharing

We share our code openly so others can:
- Learn from our architecture
- Build better privacy-preserving systems
- Improve educational technology

In return, we ask:
- **Attribute** our work
- **Share improvements** (AGPL-3.0)
- **Respect student privacy**
