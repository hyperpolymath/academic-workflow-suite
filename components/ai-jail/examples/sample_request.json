  "student_answer": "Climate change is having significant impacts on biodiversity across the planet. In marine ecosystems, rising ocean temperatures are causing coral bleaching events, which destroy the habitats of thousands of species. The Great Barrier Reef has experienced multiple bleaching events in recent years.\n\nIn terrestrial ecosystems, changing precipitation patterns are affecting forest composition. Some tree species are migrating to higher altitudes or latitudes as their traditional ranges become unsuitable. This affects the entire food web that depends on these trees.\n\nFreshwater ecosystems are also vulnerable. Warmer temperatures can lead to oxygen depletion in lakes and rivers, causing fish kills. Additionally, changing rainfall patterns affect river flow rates and wetland water levels.\n\nThe primary mechanisms are temperature changes, altered precipitation patterns, and ocean acidification in marine environments.",
