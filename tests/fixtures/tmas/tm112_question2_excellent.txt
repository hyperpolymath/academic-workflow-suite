Question 2: Discuss the role of operating systems in managing computer resources. Explain at least three key functions and how they contribute to efficient system operation. (400 words)

Answer:

An operating system (OS) serves as the critical intermediary between computer hardware and application software, managing system resources to ensure efficient, secure, and coordinated operation. The OS abstracts hardware complexity, presenting applications with a consistent interface regardless of the underlying physical components. Three fundamental functions illustrate this role: process management, memory management, and file system management.

Process management is perhaps the most visible OS function. Modern computers execute multiple processes concurrently, and the OS scheduler determines which process receives CPU time and for how long. Using scheduling algorithms such as round-robin, priority-based, or multilevel feedback queues, the OS creates the illusion of parallel execution on systems with limited processors. For example, while a user edits a document, the OS simultaneously handles background tasks like system updates and network communication. The scheduler ensures fair resource allocation, prevents process starvation, and maximizes CPU utilization. Additionally, the OS manages process states (running, waiting, blocked), handles context switching between processes, and coordinates inter-process communication (IPC) through mechanisms like pipes, message queues, and shared memory.

Memory management addresses the fundamental constraint of limited physical RAM. The OS allocates memory to processes, tracks usage, and reclaims memory when processes terminate. Virtual memory, a sophisticated memory management technique, allows systems to execute programs larger than available physical RAM by using disk storage as an extension of memory. The OS maintains page tables that map virtual addresses to physical addresses, implementing demand paging to load only necessary portions of programs into RAM. When physical memory becomes scarce, the OS employs page replacement algorithms (such as LRU or clock algorithms) to swap less-frequently-used pages to disk. This abstraction enables multiple large applications to run simultaneously on systems with modest RAM, though excessive swapping (thrashing) can severely degrade performance.

File system management provides persistent, organized storage of data. The OS abstracts the physical details of storage devices, presenting users and applications with a hierarchical directory structure. It manages file creation, deletion, reading, and writing while maintaining metadata such as permissions, timestamps, and file sizes. The OS implements access control, ensuring that users can only access files for which they have appropriate permissions, thereby maintaining security. Journaling file systems, like NTFS and ext4, maintain transaction logs to prevent data corruption during system crashes. The OS also manages file caching, keeping frequently accessed files in memory to reduce disk I/O latency.

These three functions work synergistically to create a stable, efficient computing environment. Process management ensures responsive multitasking, memory management maximizes available resources, and file system management provides reliable data persistence. Together, they enable modern operating systems to support complex applications while maintaining system stability and security.
